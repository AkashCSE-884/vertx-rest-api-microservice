# Vert.x REST API Microservice

This project is a high-performance microservice developed using Java Vert.x framework and PostgreSQL. It's designed to handle a large number of requests per second, optimized for scalability and responsiveness.

## Key Components

### Routes
Routes define the API endpoints and their corresponding handlers for processing incoming requests. They handle the routing of HTTP requests to the appropriate controllers.

### Controllers
Controllers implement the business logic for handling requests received from the routes. They orchestrate the flow of data and operations based on the incoming requests.

### Services
Services provide additional functionalities and services required by the controllers. They encapsulate reusable business logic that can be shared across different parts of the application.

### Middlewares
Middlewares house middleware functions for request processing and validation. They enhance the functionality of routes and controllers by adding pre-processing or post-processing logic to the request handling pipeline.

### Configurations
Configurations contain environment-specific settings such as database connections, API keys, and other configuration parameters. They ensure the application behaves correctly across different environments (development, staging, production).

## Testing
The microservice has been rigorously tested using Apache Benchmark load testing on a local machine. Performance metrics indicate it can handle up to 12300 requests per second under optimal conditions.
